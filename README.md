## About

You regularly pray your prayers in Arabic, but do **not really understand** what you're saying?

This app will help you make your **prayers in English** (or German or Turkish) to make them more meaningful to you. To do this, leave your device lying in front of you during the prayer and simply read the text from there. The app is purposely kept simple and reduced to the basic functions so that it does not contain distracting elements such as animations or advertising.

For more information, checkout our [FAQ section](https://community.flinesoft.com/c/prayer-app/questions) on our Community Forum.
