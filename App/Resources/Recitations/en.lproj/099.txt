When the earth quakes with her [last] mighty quaking,
and [when] the earth yields up her burdens,
and man cries out, "What has happened to her?" -
on that Day will she recount all her tidings,
as thy Sustainer will have inspired her to do!
On that Day will all men come forward, cut off from one another,
to be shown their [past] deeds.
And so, he who shall have done an atom's weight of good, shall behold it;
and he who shall have done an atom's weight of evil, shall behold it.
