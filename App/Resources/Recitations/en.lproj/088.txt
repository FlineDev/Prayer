Has there come unto thee the tiding of the Overshadowing Event?'
Some faces will on that Day be downcast,
toiling [under burdens of sin], worn out [by fear],
about to enter a glowing fire,
given to drink from a boiling spring.
No food for them save the bitterness of dry thorns,
which gives no strength and neither stills hunger.
[And] some faces will on that Day shine with bliss,
well-pleased with [the fruit of] their striving,
in a garden sublime,
wherein thou wilt hear no empty talk.
Countless springs will flow therein,
[and] there will be thrones [of happiness] raised high,
and goblets placed ready,
and cushions ranged,
and carpets spread out.
⁋
Do, then, they [who deny resurrection] never gaze at the clouds pregnant with water, [and observe] how they are created?
And at the sky, how it is raised aloft?
And at the mountains, how firmly they are reared?
And at the earth, how it is spread out?
And so, [O Prophet,] exhort them; thy task is only to exhort:
thou canst not compel them [to believe].
However, as for him who turns away, being bent on denying the truth,
him will God cause to suffer the greatest suffering [in the life to come]:
for behold, unto Us will be their return,
and verily, It is for Us to call them to account.
