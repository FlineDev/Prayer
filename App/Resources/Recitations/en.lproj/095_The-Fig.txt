Consider the fig and the olive,
and Mount Sinai,
and this land secure!
Verily, We create man in the best conformation;
and thereafter We reduce him to the lowest of low
excepting only such as attain to faith and do good works:
and theirs shall be a reward unending!
What, then, [Oman,] could henceforth cause thee to give the lie to this moral law?
Is not God the most just of judges?
