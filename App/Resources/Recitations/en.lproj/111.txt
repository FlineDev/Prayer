Doomed are the hands of him of the glowing countence: and doomed is he!
What will his wealth avail him, and all that he has gained?
[In the life to come] he shall have to endure a fire fiercely glowing;
together with his wife, that carrier of evil tales,
[who bears] around her neck a rope of twisted strands!
