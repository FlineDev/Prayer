When the sky is cleft asunder,
and when the stars are scattered,
and when the seas burst beyond their bounds,
and when the graves are overturned 
every human being will [at last] comprehend,
what he has sent ahead and what he has held back [in this world].
O man! What is it that lures thee away from thy bountiful Sustainer,
who has created thee, and formed thee in accordance with what thou art meant' to be,
and shaped thy nature in just proportions,
having put thee together in whatever form He willed [thee to have]?
Nay, [O men,] but you [are lured away from God whenever you are tempted to] give the lie to [God's] Judgment!
⁋
And yet, verily, there are ever-watchful forces over you,
noble, recording,
aware of whatever you do!
Behold, [in the life to come] the truly virtuous: will indeed be in bliss,
whereas, behold, the wicked will indeed be in a blazing fire 
[a fire] which they shall enter on Judgment Day,
and which they shall not [be able to] evade.
And what could make thee conceive what that Judgment Day will be?
And once again: What could make thee conceive what that Judgment Day will be?
[It will be] a Day when no human being shall be of the least avail to another human being:
for on that Day [it will become manifest that] all sovereignty is God's alone.
