Oh, the chargers that run panting,
sparks of fire striking,
rushing to assault at morn,
thereby raising clouds of dust,
thereby storming [blindly] into any host!
Verily, towards his Sustainer man is most ungrateful
and to this, behold, he [himself] bears witness indeed:
for, verily, to the love of wealth is he most ardently devoted.
But does he not know that [on the Last Day,] when all that is in the graves is raised and brought out,
and all that is [hidden] in men's hearts is bared
that on that Day their Sustainer [will show that He] has always been fully aware of them?
