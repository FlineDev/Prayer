Consider the heavens and that which comes in the night!
And what could make thee conceive what it is that comes in the night?
It is the star that pierces through [life's] darkness:
[for] no human being has ever been left unguarded.
Let Man, then, observe out of what he has been created:
he has been created out of a seminal fluid
issuing from between the loins [of man] and the pelvic arch [of woman].
Now, verily, He [who thus creates man in the first instance] is well able to bring him back [to life]
on the Day when all I secrets will be laid bare,
and [man] will have neither strength nor helper!
Consider the heavens, ever-revolving,
and the earth, bursting forth with plants!
Behold, this [divine writ] is indeed a word that between truth and falsehood,
and is no idle tale.
Behold, they [who refuse to accept it] devise many a false argument [to disprove its truth];
but I shall bring all their scheming to nought.
Let, then, the deniers of the truth have their will: let them have their will for a little while.
