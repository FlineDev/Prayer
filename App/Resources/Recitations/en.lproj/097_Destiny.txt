Behold, from on high have We bestowed this [divine writ] on Night of Destiny.
And what could make thee conceive what it is, that Night of Destiny?
The Night of Destiny is better than a thousand months:
in hosts descend in it the angels, bearing divine inspiration by their Sustainer's leave;
from all [evil] that may happen
does it make secure, until the rise of dawn.
