It is not [conceivable] that such as are bent on denying the truth -
[be they] from among the followers of earlier revelation or from among those who ascribe divinity to aught beside God -
should ever be abandoned [by Him] ere there comes unto them the [full] evidence of the truth:
an apostle from God, conveying [unto them] revelations blest with purity,
wherein there are ordinances of ever-true soundness and clarity.
Now those who have been vouchsafed revelation aforetime did break up their unity [of faith] after such an evidence of the truth had come to them.
And withal, they were not enjoined aught but that they should worship God,
sincere in their faith in Him alone, turning away from all that is false;
and that they should be constant in prayer;
and that they should spend in charity:
for this is a moral law endowed with ever-true soundness and clarity.
Verily, those who [despite all evidence] are bent on denying the truth -
[be they] from among the followers of earlier revelation or from among those who ascribe divinity to aught beside God -
will find themselves in the fire of hell, therein to abide:
they are the worst of all creatures.
[And,] verily, those who have attained to faith, and do righteous deeds -
it is they, they who are the best of all creatures.
Their reward [awaits them] with God:
gardens of perpetual bliss, through which running waters flow,
therein to abide beyond the count of time; well-pleased is God with them,
and well-pleased are they with Him:
all this awaits him who of his Sustainer stands in awe!
