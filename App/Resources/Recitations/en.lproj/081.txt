Hen the sun is shrouded in darkness,
and when the stars lose their light,
and when the mountains are made to vanish,
and when she-camels big with young, about to give birth, are left untended,
and when all beasts are gathered together,
and when the seas boil over,
and when all human beings are coupled [with their deeds],
and when the girl-child that was buried alive is made to ask
for what crime she had been slain,
and when the scrolls [of men's deeds] are unfolded,
and when heaven is laid bare,
and when the blazing fire [of hell] is kindled bright,
and when paradise is brought into view:
[on that Day] every human being will come to know what he has prepared [for himself].
⁋
But Nay! I call to witness the revolving stars,
the planets that run their course and set,
and the night as it darkly falls,
and the morn as it softly breathes:
behold, this [divine writ] is indeed the [inspired] word of a noble apostle,
with strength endowed, secure with Him who in almightiness is enthroned
[the word] of one to be heeded, and worthy of trust!
For, this fellow-man of yours is not a madman:
he truly beheld [the angel - beheld] him on the clear horizon;
and he is not one to begrudge others the knowledge [of whatever has been revealed to him] out of that which is beyond the reach of human Perception.
Nor is this [message] the word of any satanic force accursed.
Whither, then, will you go?
This [message] is no less than a reminder to all mankind 
to everyone of you who wills to walk a straight way.
But you cannot will it unless God, the Sustainer of all the worlds, wills [to show you that way].
