Hast thou ever considered [the kind of man] who gives the lie to all moral law?
Behold, it is this [kind of man] that thrusts the orphan away,
and feels no urge to feed the needy.
Woe, then, unto those praying ones
whose hearts from their prayer are remote
those who want only to be seen and praised,
and, withal, deny all assistance [to their fellow-men]!
