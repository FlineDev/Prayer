Consider the night as it veils [the earth] in darkness,
and the day as it rises bright!
Consider the creation of the male and the female!
Verily, [O men,] you aim at most divergent ends!
Thus, as for him who gives [to others] and is conscious of God,
and believes in the truth of the ultimate good -
for him shall We make easy the path towards [ultimate] ease.
But as for him who is niggardly, and thinks that he is self-sufficient,
and calls the ultimate good a lie
for him shall We make easy the path towards hardship:
and what will his wealth avail him when he goes down [to his grave]?
Behold, it is indeed for Us to grace [you] with guidance;
and, behold, Ours is [the dominion over] the life to come as well as [over] this earlier part [of your life]:
and so I warn you of the raging fire -
[the fire] which none shall have to endure but that most hapless wretch
who gives the lie to the truth and turns away [from it].
For, distant from it shall remain he who is truly conscious of God:
he that spends his possessions [on others] so that he might grow in purity
not as payment for favours received,
but only out of a longing for the countenance of his Sustainer, the All-Highest:
and such, indeed, shall in time be well-pleased.
