All that is in the heavens and all that is on earth extols God's limitless glory:
His is all dominion, and to Him all praise is due; and He has the power to will anything.
He it is who has created you: and among you are such as deny this truth, and among you are such as believe [in it].
And God sees all that you do.
He has created the heavens and the earth in accordance with [an inner] truth,
and has formed you - and formed you so well; and with Him is your journey's end.
He knows all that is in the heavens and on earth;
and He knows all that you keep secret as well as all that you bring into the open:
for God has full knowledge of what is in the hearts [of men].
⁋
Have the stories of those who, in earlier times, refused to acknowledge the truth never yet come within your ken?
[They denied it -] and so they had to taste the evil outcome of their own doings,
with [more] grievous suffering awaiting them [in the life to come]:
this, because time and again there came unto them their apostles with all evidence of the truth,
but they [always] replied, "Shall mere mortal men be our guides?"
And so they denied the truth and turned away.
But God was not in need [of them]: for God is self-sufficient, ever to be praised.
They who are bent on denying the truth claim that they will never be raised from the dead!
Say: "Yea, by my Sustainer! Most surely will you be raised from the dead, and then,
most surely, will you be made to understand what you did [in life]!
For, easy is this for God!"
⁋
Believe then, [O men,] in God and His Apostle,
and in the light [of revelation] which We have bestowed [on you] from on high!
And God is fully aware of all that you do.
[Think of] the time when He shall gather you all together unto the Day of the [Last] Gathering
- that Day of Loss and Gain! For, as for him who shall have believed in God and done what is just and right,
He will [on that Day] efface his bad deeds,
and will admit him into gardens through which running waters flow,
therein to abide beyond the count of time: that will be a triumph supreme!
But as for those who are bent on denying the truth and on giving the lie to Our messages
- they are destined for the fire, therein to abide: and how vile a journey's end!
No calamity can ever befall [man] unless it be by God's leave:
hence, whoever believes in God guides his [own] heart [towards this truth];
and God has full knowledge of everything.
⁋
Pay heed, then, unto God, and pay heed unto the Apostle;
and if you turn away, [know that] Our Apostle's only duty is a clear delivery of this message:
God - there is no deity save Him! In God then let the believers place their trust.
O you who have attained to faith! Behold, some of your spouses and your children are enemies unto you: so beware of them!
But if you pardon [their faults] and forbear, and forgive-then, behold, God will be much-forgiving, a dispenser of grace.
Your worldly goods and your children are but a trial and a temptation, whereas with God there is a tremendous reward.
Remain, then, conscious of God as best you can, and listen [to Him], and pay heed.
And spend in charity for the good of your own selves:
for, such as from their own covetousness are saved  it is they, they that shall attain to a happy state!
If you offer up to God a goodly loan, He will amply repay you for it,
and will forgive you your sins: for God is ever responsive to gratitude, forbearing,
knowing all that is beyond the reach of a created being's perception as well as all that can be witnessed by a creature's senses or mind - the Almighty, the Wise!
