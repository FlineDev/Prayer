Consider the daybreak
and the ten nights!
Consider the multiple and the One!
Consider the night as it runs its course!
Considering all this - could there be, to anyone endowed with reason, a [more] solemn evidence of the truth?
Art thou not aware of how thy Sustainer has dealt with [the tribe of] 'Ad,
[the people of] Iram the many-pillared,
the like of whom has never been reared in all the land? 
and with [the tribe of] Thamud,  who hollowed out rocks in the valley? 
and with Pharaoh of the [many] tent-poles?
[It was they] who transgressed all bounds of equity all over their lands,
and brought about great corruption therein:
and therefore thy Sustainer let loose upon them a scourge of suffering:
for, verily, thy Sustainer is ever on the watch!
⁋
But as for man,  whenever his Sustainer tries him by His generosity and by letting him enjoy a life of ease,
he says, "My Sustainer has been [justly] generous towards me";
whereas, whenever He tries him by straitening his means of livelihood, he says, "My Sustainer has disgraced me!"
But nay, nay, [O men, consider all that you do and fail to do:] you are not generous towards the orphan,
and you do not urge one another to feed the needy,
and you devour the inheritance [of others] with devouring greed,
and you love wealth with boundless love!
Nay, but [how will you fare on Judgment Day,] when the earth is crushed with crushing upon crushing,
and [the majesty of] thy Sustainer stands revealed,
as well as [the true nature of] the angels; rank upon rank?
⁋
And on that Day hell will be brought [within sight];
on that Day man will remember [all that he did and failed to do]: but what will that remembrance avail him?
He will say, "Oh, would that I had. provided beforehand for my life [to come]!"
For, none can make suffer as He will make suffer [the sinners] on that Day,
and none can bind with bonds like His.
[But unto the righteous God will say,] "O thou human being that hast attained to inner peace!
Return thou unto thy Sustainer, well-pleased [and] pleasing [Him]:
enter, then, together with My [other true] servants 
yea, enter thou My paradise!"
