Woe unto those who give short measure:
those who, when they are to receive their due from [other] people, demand that it be given in full 
but when they have to measure or weigh whatever they owe to others, give less than what is due!*
Do they not know that they are bound to be raised from the dead
[and called to account] on an awesome Day 
the Day when all men shall stand before the Sustainer of all the worlds?
Nay, verily, the record of the wicked is indeed [set down] in a mode inescapable!
And what could make thee conceive what that that mode inescapable will be?
A record [indelibly] inscribed!
Woe on that Day unto those who give the lie to the truth 
those who give the lie to the [coming of] Judgment Day:
for, none gives the lie to it but such as are wont to transgress against all that is [and are] immersed in sin:
[and so,] whenever Our messages are conveyed to them, they but say, "Fables of ancient times!"
⁋
Nay, but their hearts are corroded by all [the evil] that they were wont to do!
Nay, verily, from [the grace of] their Sustainer shall they on that Day be debarred;
and then, behold, they shall enter the blazing fire
and be told: "This is the [very thing] to which you were wont to give the lie!"
Nay, verily - the record of the truly virtuous is [set down] in a mode most lofty!
And what could make thee conceive what that mode most lofty will be?
A record [indelibly] inscribed,
witnessed~ by all who have [ever] been drawn close unto God.
Behold, [in the life to come] the truly virtuous will indeed be in bliss:
[resting on couches, they will look up [to God]:
upon their faces thou wilt see the brightness of bliss.
They will be given a drink of pure wine whereon the seal [of God] will have been set,
pouring forth with a fragrance of musk.
⁋
To that [wine of paradise], then, let all such aspire as [are willing to] aspire to things of high account:
for it is composed of all that is most exalting
a source [of bliss] whereof those who are drawn close unto God shall drink.
Behold, those who have abandoned themselves to sin are wont to laugh at such as have attained to faith
and whenever they pass by them, they wink at one another [derisively];
and whenever they return to people of their own kind,  they return full of jests;
and whenever they see those [who believe,] they say, "Behold, these [people] have indeed gone astray!"
And, withal, they have no call to watch over [the beliefs of] others. . .
But on the Day [of Judgment], they who had attained to faith will [be able to] laugh at the [erstwhile] deniers of the truth:
[for, resting in paradise] on couches, they will look on [and say to themselves]:
"Are these deniers of the truth being [thus] requited for [aught but] what they were wont to do?"
