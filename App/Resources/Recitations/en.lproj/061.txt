All that is in the heavens and all that is on earth extols God's limitless glory: for He alone is almighty, truly wise!
O you who have attained to faith! Why do you say one thing and do another?
Most loathsome is it in the sight of God that you say what you do not do!
Verily, God loves [only] those who fight in His cause in [solid] ranks,
as though they were a building firm and compact.
Now when Moses spoke to his people, [it was this same truth that he had in mind:]
"O my people! Why do you cause me grief,
the while you know that I am an apostle of God sent unto you?"
And so, when they swerved from the right way, God let their hearts swerve from the truth:
for God does not bestow His guidance upon iniquitous folk.
⁋
And [this happened, too,] when Jesus, the son of Mary, said:
"O children of Israel! Behold, I am an apostle of God unto you, [sent] to confirm the truth of whatever there still remains of the Torah,
and to give [you] the glad tiding of an apostle who shall come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad."
But when he [whose coming Jesus had foretold] came unto them with all evidence of the truth, they said:
"This [alleged message of his] is [nothing but] spellbinding eloquence!"
And who could be more wicked than one who invents [such] a lie about [a message from] God,
seeing that he is [but] being called to self-surrender unto Him?
But God does not bestow His guidance upon evil-doing folk.
⁋
They aim to extinguish God's light with their utterances:
but God has willed to spread His light in all its fullness,
however hateful this may be to all who deny the truth
He it is who has sent forth His Apostle with [the task of] spreading guidance and the religion of truth,
to the end that He make it prevail over all [false] religion,
however hateful this may be to those who ascribe divinity to aught but God.
O you who have attained to faith!
Shall I point out to you a bargain that will save you from grievous suffering [in this world and in the life to come]?
You are to believe in God and His Apostle,
and to strive hard in God's cause with your possessions and your lives:
this is for your own good - if you but knew it!
[If you do so,] He will forgive you your sins,
and [in the life to come] will admit you into gardens through which running waters flow,
and into goodly mansions in [those] gardens of perpetual bliss: that [will be] the triumph supreme!
⁋
And [withal, He will grant you] yet another thing that you dearly love:
succour from God [in this world], and a victory soon to come:
and [thereof, O Prophet,] give thou a glad tiding to all who believe.
O you who have attained to faith!
Be helpers [in the cause of God - even as Jesus, the son of Mary,
said unto the white-garbed ones, "Who will be my helpers in God's cause?" - whereupon the white-garbed [disciples] replied,
"We shall be [thy] helpers [in the cause] of God!"
And so [it happened that] some of the children of Israel came to believe [in the apostleship of Jesus], whereas others denied the truth.
But [now] We have given strength against their foes unto those who have [truly] attained to faith:
and they have become the ones that shall prevail.
